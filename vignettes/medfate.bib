abstract = {Increasing drought is one of the most critical challenges facing species and ecosystems worldwide, and improved theory and practices are needed for quantification of species tolerances. Leaf water potential at turgor loss, or wilting ($\pi$(tlp) ), is classically recognised as a major physiological determinant of plant water stress response. However, the cellular basis of $\pi$(tlp) and its importance for predicting ecological drought tolerance have been controversial. A meta-analysis of 317 species from 72 studies showed that $\pi$(tlp) was strongly correlated with water availability within and across biomes, indicating power for anticipating drought responses. We derived new equations giving both $\pi$(tlp) and relative water content at turgor loss point (RWC(tlp) ) as explicit functions of osmotic potential at full turgor ($\pi$(o) ) and bulk modulus of elasticity ($\epsilon$). Sensitivity analyses and meta-analyses showed that $\pi$(o) is the major driver of $\pi$(tlp) . In contrast, $\epsilon$ plays no direct role in driving drought tolerance within or across species, but sclerophylly and elastic adjustments act to maintain RWC(tlp,) preventing cell dehydration, and additionally protect against nutrient, mechanical and herbivory stresses independent of drought tolerance. These findings clarify biogeographic trends and the underlying basis of drought tolerance parameters with applications in comparative assessments of species and ecosystems worldwide.},

abstract = {Shifts in rainfall patterns and increasing temperatures associated with climate change are likely to cause widespread forest decline in regions where droughts are predicted to increase in duration and severity. One primary cause of productivity loss and plant mortality during drought is hydraulic failure. Drought stress creates trapped gas emboli in the water transport system, which reduces the ability of plants to supply water to leaves for photosynthetic gas exchange and can ultimately result in desiccation and mortality. At present we lack a clear picture of how thresholds to hydraulic failure vary across a broad range of species and environments, despite many individual experiments. Here we draw together published and unpublished data on the vulnerability of the transport system to drought-induced embolism for a large number of woody species, with a view to examining the likely consequences of climate change for forest biomes. We show that 70% of 226 forest species from 81 sites worldwide operate with narrow (<1 megapascal) hydraulic safety margins against injurious levels of drought stress and therefore potentially face long-term reductions in productivity and survival if temperature and aridity increase as predicted for many regions across the globe. Safety margins are largely independent of mean annual precipitation, showing that there is global convergence in the vulnerability of forests to drought, with all forest biomes equally vulnerable to hydraulic failure regardless of their current rainfall environment. These findings provide insight into why drought-induced forest decline is occurring not only in arid regions but also in wet forests not normally considered at drought risk.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Aim: Stomata regulate CO 2 uptake, water-vapour loss and uptake of gaseous pollutants. Jarvis-type models that apply multiple-constraint functions are commonly used to estimate stomatal conductance (g s ), but most parameters for plant functional types (PFTs) have been estimated using limited information. We refined the data set of key components of the g s response to environmental factors in global PFTs. Location: Global. Time period: Data published in 1973-2015. Major taxa studied: Woody plants and major crops (rice, wheat and maize). Methods: We reviewed 235 publications of field-observed g s for the parameterization of Jarvis-type models in global PFTs. The relationships between stomatal parameters and climatic factors [mean annual air temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP)] were assessed. Results: We found that maximal stomatal conductance (g max ) in global woody plants was correlated with MAP rather than with MAT. The g max of woody plants on average increased from 0.18 to 0.26 mol/m 2 /s with an increase in MAP from 0 to 2,000 mm. Models, however, can use a single g max across major crops (0.44 mol/m 2 /s). We propose similar stomatal responses to light for C 3 crops and woody plants, but C 4 crops should use a higher light saturation point of g s . Stomatal sensitivity to vapour-pressure deficit (VPD) was similar across forest PFTs and crops, although desert shrubs had a relatively low sensitivity of stomata to VPD. The optimal temperature for g s increased by 1 °C for every 3.0 °C of MAT. Stomatal sensitivity to predawn water potential was reduced in hot and dry climate. The fraction of nighttime conductance to g max (0.14 for forest trees, 0.28 for desert shrubs and 0.13 for crops) should be incorporated into the models. Main conclusions: This analysis of global g s data provides a new summary of g s responses and will contribute to modelling studies for plant-atmosphere gas exchange and land-surface energy partitioning.},

abstract = {Plant traits - the morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and phenological characteristics of plants and their organs - determine how primary producers respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels, influence ecosystem processes and services and provide a link from species richness to ecosystem functional diversity. Trait data thus represent the raw material for a wide range of research from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology to biogeography. Here we present the global database initiative named TRY, which has united a wide range of the plant trait research community worldwide and gained an unprecedented buy-in of trait data: so far 93 trait databases have been contributed. The data repository currently contains almost three million trait entries for 69000 out of the world's 300000 plant species, with a focus on 52 groups of traits characterizing the vegetative and regeneration stages of the plant life cycle, including growth, dispersal, establishment and persistence. A first data analysis shows that most plant traits are approximately log-normally distributed, with widely differing ranges of variation across traits. Most trait variation is between species (interspecific), but significant intraspecific variation is also documented, up to 40% of the overall variation. Plant functional types (PFTs), as commonly used in vegetation models, capture a substantial fraction of the observed variation - but for several traits most variation occurs within PFTs, up to 75% of the overall variation. In the context of vegetation models these traits would better be represented by state variables rather than fixed parameter values. The improved availability of plant trait data in the unified global database is expected to support a paradigm shift from species to trait-based ecology, offer new opportunities for synthetic plant trait research and enable a more realistic and empirically grounded representation of terrestrial vegetation in Earth system models. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Martin-StPaul2017,
abstract = {10 Plant resistance to drought has long been thought to be associated with the ability to maintain 11 transpiration and photosynthesis longer during drought, through the opening of stomata. This premise 12 is at the root of most current framework used to assess drought impacts on land plants in vegetation 13 models. We examined this premise by coupling a meta-analysis of functional traits of stomatal response 14 to drought (i.e. the water potential causing stomatal closure, $\psi$close) and embolism resistance (the water 15 potential at the onset of embolism formation, $\Psi$12), with simulations from a soil-plant hydraulic model. 16 We found that $\psi$close and $\Psi$12 were equal (isometric) only for a restricted number of species, but as $\Psi$12 17 decreases, the departure from isometry increases, with stomatal closure occurring far before embolism 18 occurs. For the most drought resistant species ($\Psi$12<-4.2 MPa), $\Psi$close was remarkably independent of 19 embolism resistance and remained above -4.5 MPa, suggesting the existence of a restrictive boundary 20 by which stomata closure must occur. This pattern was supported by model simulations. Indeed, 21 coordinated decrease in both $\psi$close and $\psi$12 leads to unsuspected accelerated death under drought for 22 embolism resistant species, in contradiction with observations from drought mortality experiments. 23 Overall our results highlight that most species have similarity in stomatal behavior, and are highly 24 conservative in terms of their water use during drought. The modelling framework presented here 25 provides a baseline to simulate the temporal dynamic leading to mortality under drought by accounting 26 for multiple, measurable traits. 27 28 29 30 31 .

@article{Mencuccini2019,
abstract = {Biomass and area ratios between leaves, stems and roots regulate many physiological and ecological processes. The Huber value Hv (sapwood area/leaf area ratio) is central to plant water balance and drought responses. However, its coordination with key plant functional traits is poorly understood, which prevents developing trait‐based prediction models.

Based on theoretical arguments, we hypothesise that global patterns in Hv of terminal woody branches can be predicted from variables related to plant trait spectra, i.e., plant hydraulics and size and leaf economics.

Using a global compilation of 1135 species‐averaged Hv, we show that Hv varies over 3 orders of magnitude. Higher Hv are seen in short small‐leaved low‐SLA shrubs with low Ks in arid relative to tall large‐leaved high‐SLA trees with high Ks in moist environments. All traits depend on climate but climatic correlations are stronger for explanatory traits than Hv. Negative isometry is found between Hv and Ks, suggesting a compensation to maintain hydraulic supply to leaves across species.

This work identifies the major global drivers of branch sapwood/leaf area ratios. Our approach based on widely available traits facilitates the development of accurate models of aboveground biomass allocation and helps predict vegetation responses to drought.},

Trait data were obtained from a comprehensive literature review, plus some field and experimental observations. All records are fully referenced and, in many cases, include geographic coordinates. The database is structured to include different levels of accuracy of trait information for each entry. BROT 2.0 should facilitate testing hypotheses on plant functional ecology within the Mediterranean Basin, and comparing this region with other ecosystems worldwide. The BROT 2.0 database and its trait definitions can be used as a template for creating similar trait databases in other regions of the world.},
